# Indian States Explorer

A lightweight, static website that showcases **all States & Union Territories of India** with their key facts — **capital, population, location, tourist spots, culture, festivals, industries** — built with **HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript (DOM)**.  
No frameworks, no build tools: just clean, accessible, and performant web fundamentals.

## Features

- **Dynamic Rendering with DOM**  
  All state and UT information is injected into the page via JavaScript DOM methods — no hard-coded HTML duplication.  

- **Detail View**  
  Click on a state card to open a **modal/detail panel** with full information (culture, festivals, industries, tourist spots).  

- **Responsive Design**  
  Mobile-first grid layout; switches between **card grid** and **table view** depending on screen size. *(Minor changes required)*
